# Linear-Regression-Project

This project explores linear regression (without using any machine learning API) to predict the housing prices in Boston city. The use of gradient desccent (also from scratch) is also explored to optimize the values of the coefficients. The accuracy of the created model is then compared with the sklearn model.
